<h5 align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height:40px;")>"Data cleansing or data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting 
(or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or 
irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data.[1] Data cleansing may be performed interactively 
with data wrangling tools, or as batch processing through scripting. After cleansing, a data set should be consistent with other similar data sets 
in the system. The inconsistencies detected or removed may have been originally caused by user entry errors, by corruption in transmission or storage, 
or by different data dictionary definitions of similar entities in different stores. Data cleaning differs from data validation in that validation 
almost invariably means data is rejected from the system at entry and is performed at the time of entry, rather than on batches of data.
The actual process of data cleansing may involve removing typographical errors or validating and correcting values against a known list of entities. 
The validation may be strict (such as rejecting any address that does not have a valid postal code) or fuzzy (such as correcting records that partially 
match existing, known records). Some data cleansing solutions will clean data by cross checking with a validated data set. A common data cleansing practice 
is data enhancement, where data is made more complete by adding related information. For example, appending addresses with any phone numbers related to 
that address. Data cleansing may also involve activities like, harmonization of data, and standardization of data. For example, harmonization of short 
codes (st, rd, etc.) to actual words (street, road, etcetera). Standardization of data is a means of changing a reference data set to a new standard, 
ex, use of standard codes.</p>
