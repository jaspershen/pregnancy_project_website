Mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics has emerged as a powerful technique for bi-omarker discovery in clinical and epidemiologic research. However, the metabolomics dataset features high dimensionality, uncertain degrees of missing values, zero values, nonlinearity, unwanted variations, and non-normality. Therefore, prior to differential metabolite discovery analysis, various types of data cleaning processing such as missing value imputation, data normalization and scaling is required. Here, we introduce an interactive and integrated web server, namely, MetFlow, to provide a comprehensive data cleaning and differential metabolite discovery pipeline for metabolomics.

Untargeted metabolomics study of biological samples (e.g. urine and serum from patients) provides functional readouts of physio-logical and pathological states of biological individuals at the sys-tems level, and can be used to discover potential biomarkers for disease (Johnson, et al., 2016). After data acquisition using mass spectrometry, programs such as XCMS can be used to process raw data within the following steps: peak detection, peak alignment, retention time correction, and peak grouping. Sometimes, metabo-lite identification is also performed during this step (Zhu, et al., 2013).
However, during the long period of data acquisition, MS intensi-ty drift is unavoidable and becomes a major confounding factor for large-scale metabolomics studies, and the dataset features high dimensionality, uncertain degrees of missing values (MV), zero values, nonlinearity, unwanted variations, and non-normality. Therefore, prior to differential analysis, various types of data cleaning is necessary to remove noisy signals, reduce unwanted variations, and integrate multiple batches to form an integral and high quality dataset. As much as complexity of data processing, there is a need to create a comprehensive, integrative, integrated and user-friendly software for common users with limited background on bioinformatics. However, referring to the capabili-ties of the tools mainly used (as shown in Supplementary Materi-als and the extensive review in the publication of metaX (Wen et al., 2017) and the most recent publication of MetaboDiff (Mock et al., 2018), we found that they still requiring too much experiment-level knowledge about the details of metabolomics and bioinfor-matics. To this end, we introduce MetFlow, an interactive and inte-grated web server for metabolomics data cleaning and differential metabolite discovery. The defining features what we believe makes MetFlow more integrated and user-friendly than previous tools are 1) the simple, integrated and integrative interface, 2) the compre-hensive and current gold standards for batch alignment, missing value imputation, normalization, outlier processing and so on, 3) the ability to be compatible with different types of data from dif-ferent instrument (LC-MS, GC-MS) and different data acquisition methods (DDA, DIA and MRM), 4) the ability to process large-scale metabolomics data with batch alignment and QC-based nor-malization methods and 5) a step-by-step workflow and detailed tutorial.
