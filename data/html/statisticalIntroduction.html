<h5 align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height:40px;")>"What is statistical analysis? It is the science of collecting, exploring
                              and presenting large amounts of data to discover underlying patterns and
                              trends. Statistics are applied every day – in research, industry and
                              government – to become more scientific about decisions that need to be made.
                              For example: Manufacturers use statistics to weave quality into beautiful fabrics,
                              to bring lift to the airline industry and to help guitarists make beautiful music.
                              Researchers keep children healthy by using statistics to analyze data from the production of viral vaccines, 
							  which ensures consistency and safety. Communication companies use statistics to optimize network resources, 
							  improve service and reduce customer churn by gaining greater insight into subscriber requirements.
                              Government agencies around the world rely on statistics for a clear understanding of their countries, 
							  their businesses and their people. Look around you. From the tube of toothpaste in your bathroom to 
							  the planes flying overhead, you see hundreds of products and processes every day that have been 
							  improved through the use of statistics.",</p>
